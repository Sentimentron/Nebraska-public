Turk Data Visualisation Tool
============================

A quick webapp I built to visualise the data we get back from Turk.

Running
=======

The app is written in Ruby so you'll need that to run it, I developed it under ruby 1.9.2p320 (2012-04-20 revision 35421) and
you'll probably want to use RVM to install Ruby. Then use bundle install to install the gems.

I already had all the required gems to run this app so I can't be sure I included all the required gems in the Gemfile
so you may have to edit it, if it doesnt work.

Finally to run the tool use ruby server.rb then navigate to localhost:4567.
